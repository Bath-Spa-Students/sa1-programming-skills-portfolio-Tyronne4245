# First step is to create a function that asks a user for the capital of France
user_answer = input("What is the capital of France? ")

# Next step is to create another function that checks the answer and prints different message depending on the answer
if user_answer == "Paris":
    print("Your Answer is Correct. It is Paris")
else:
    print("Your Answer is Wrong. The Correct Answer is Paris")
